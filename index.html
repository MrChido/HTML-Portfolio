<h2>A brief Summary of myself</h2>

<p>Kansas City born and raised, this is where I have spent most of my days. Ok, enough of that before I commit copyright infringement(again).
  I have lived all over town and have experienced in my lifetime a multitude of the events that go on around Kansas City.
  I have a decent knowledge of my home town and am always eager to learn and experience more. In fact, I thrive on them; things that I have never done before, even if I feel a bit intimidated.
I am a sociable person, a bit stand-offish, mom always told me that I really do live to the sound of my own drum.
     If there is one thing I can guarantee you about myself is that I am unforgettable.</p>

<p>What you will find in this website/project are pages that reflect some of the most influential things that employers should know about me. My resume page offers an approximate 5-year history of my previous places of employment as well as some of the skills I have acquired over the years.
  It also offers a link to download my resume for future reference and contact information. The projects page offers a look into my creative side.
  I am quite proud of some of those projects. I believe they showcase myself very well. I encourage you to look and see what I have to offer as a prospective employee.</p>

<p>I have recently taken up beekeeping. Ironicaly, bees have actualy been a part of my life, it has only been recently that I have noticed this fact.
   I started last year and it has been a very exciting and interesting journey, one I intend to persue for decades to come.
   My wife and I have started a blog on facebook! we are known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BirdsNBeesKC" target=" ">BirdsNBeesKC</a>. It exhibits my journey in beekeeping, and my wifes aviary asperations.
