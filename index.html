<h2>A brief Summary of myself</h2>

 <p>Kansas City born and raised, this is where I have spent most of my days. Ok, enough of that before I commit copyright infringement(again).
  I have lived all over town and have experienced in my lifetime a multitude of the events that go on around Kansas City.
  I have a decent knowledge of my home town and am always eager to learn and experience more. In fact, I thrive on them; things that I have never done before, even if I feel a bit intimidated.
I am a sociable person, a bit stand-offish, mom always told me that I really do live to the sound of my own drum.
     If there is one thing I can guarantee you about myself is that I am unforgettable.</p>

<p>What you will find in this website/project are pages that reflect some of the most influential things that employers should know about me. My resume page offers an approximate 5-year history of my previous places of employment as well as some of the skills I have acquired over the years.
  It also offers a link to download my resume for future reference and contact information. The projects page offers a look into my creative side this includes things ranging from graphic media to visual media that I have placed on YouTube.
  I am quite proud of some of those projects. I believe they showcase myself very well. I encourage you to look and see what I have to offer as a prospective employee.</p>
